# FacebookBot

This was a fun project I made in first-year computer science. As a member of the AEPi fraternity, we were looking for an easy way to find potential rushes. AEPi is a Jewish boys fraternity, so I created a facebook bot that would search York University student groups on Facebook for Jewish boys names, add them to a rush list, and personally message them. Selenium automation library was used to implement.
