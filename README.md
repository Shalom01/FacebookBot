# FacebookBot

A fun project I made in my first-year of computer science. I am a member of the AEPi fraternity, and at the time we were looking for an efficient way to find potential rushes. AEPi is a Jewish boys fraternity, so I created a Facebook bot that would search York University student groups on Facebook for Jewish boys names, add them to a rush list, and personally message them. Selenium automation library was used to implement.
